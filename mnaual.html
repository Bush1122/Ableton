                        1. Introduction
                    </h2>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-2">
                        Ableton Push is an expressive instrument for music-making that lets you create and edit
                        melodies, harmonies, beats, and samples, as well as entire songs. As a standalone instrument,
                        Push lets you stay focused on song creation in or out of the studio. You can seamlessly send
                        your Live Sets to Push and vice versa.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-3 mb-2">Push also functions as a hub where you can control and record a wide range of
                        acoustic and electronic instruments simultaneously. On stage, Push serves as a powerful
                        instrument for real-time playing, step sequencing, and clip launching, with or without a
                        computer.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3 mb-2">You can use this manual to get familiar with Push’s fundamental workflows, or
                        as a general reference for Push’s features and controls. There are also a number of videos that
                        can help you get started with Push available here: <a

                    <p class="mt-3">
                        Push comes with a power supply, USB-C cable, getting started guide, safety and warranty

                        <p class="mt-3">
                            Push comes in two configurations. The first configuration includes a processor, battery, and
                            an
                            SSD hard drive, which allows you to use Push as a standalone instrument. The second does not
                            come with those components, so Push must be connected to a computer to make music using
                            Live.

                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3">
                            An upgrade kit containing the necessary components to use Push standalone will be available
                            in
                            late 2023 from the Ableton Web Shop, so you can upgrade your Push later as needed.

                        </p>

                            In terms of features, there is no difference between Push units with or without a processor,
                            the
                            only difference is that units with a processor can be used to make music without being
                            connected
                            to a computer.

                            When using Push in Control Mode, it is recommended to also connect the power supply in order
                            to ensure maximum display brightness and prevent battery drainage. For more details, see
                            Push USB power FAQ.</p>
