                <p>Updated: September 2023</p>


                <p class="mt-3">Ableton AG, Schönhauser Allee 6-7, D-10119 Berlin herewith informs you about the
                    processing of personal data for which Ableton is the responsible controller according to the
                    provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Your data may also be processed by
                    other companies belonging to the Ableton group, whereas such data processing is based on Adequacy
                    Decisions by the EU Commission and EU standard contractual clauses (with additional safeguards where
                    legally required).

                        <h6>1.1 Server-log data</h6>
                        <p>When using our websites, certain information is sent to the server of our websites by the

                            <br> (i) We process the following data for the purpose of providing the contents of the
                            website that you have visited, to ensure the security of the IT infrastructure used, to
                            correct errors, to enable and simplify searches on the website and to manage cookies.

                            <br> (ii) The data processed is HTTP data: HTTP data is protocol data that is generated when
                            the Websites is visited via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure) (HTTP(S)) for technical
                            reasons: This includes IP address, type and version of your Internet browser, operating

                            the visit. HTTP(S) data also accumulates on the servers of service providers (for example:
                            when requesting third-party content).

                            <br> (iii) The legal basis for the processing of the abovementioned data is our legitimate
                            interest in the operation of an online presence, communication with communication partners
                            and internal compliance reporting (Article 6 para. (1) (f) GDPR).

                            <br> (iv) The data is automatically transmitted by the browser of the user.

                            will be deleted after six months.

                            <br> (vii) Without disclosure of personal data such as the IP address, the use of the
                            website is not possible. Communication via the website without disclosure of data is
                            technically not possible.
                        </p>

                        <h6>1.2 Technically required cookies</h6>
                        <p>We use cookies on our websites. Cookies are small text files containing information that can
                            be stored on the user's device via the browser when visiting a website. The information
                            stored in cookies can be read out and processed when the website is visited again using the
                            same device. In doing so, we use processing and storage functions of the browser of your
                            device and collect information from the storage of the browser of your device.

                            In the structure of our privacy policy, we differentiate between technically required
                            cookies and tracking cookies. Cookies that are technically required for the functioning of
                            the websites cannot be deactivated via the cookie management function of the websites.
                            However, you can generally deactivate cookies at any time in your browser. Different
                            browsers offer different ways to configure the cookie settings in the browser. However, we
                            would like to point out that some functions of the websites may not or no longer function
                            properly if you generally deactivate cookies in your browser settings.</p>

                            <br>(iii) The legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest of easy and reliable
                            control of cookies settings in accordance with the respective user decisions and improving

                            transmitted by the user's browser (protocol data, time stamp).

                            <br>(v) Recipients of the personal data are IT service providers which we use as processors
                            within the framework of a data processing agreement.

                            store your applicant data in our applicant pool for the purpose of contacting you again. In
                            this case, we may also contact you in the future with suitable job offers that match your
                            profile. There are no plans to change these purposes.

                            documents including certificates and curriculum vitae, time stamp of communication as well

                            <br>(iii) The legal basis is Section 26 German Federal Data Protection Act (2017) in

                            charge of the decision-making. We also use service providers as processors within the
                            framework of a data processing agreement for the provision of services, especially the

                            the event of a requested inclusion in our applicant pool, your data will be deleted if you

                            give your consent to the inclusion of your applicant data in our applicant pool, this will
                            not result in disadvantages for you in future application procedures.

                            evaluations about Loop Events, documenting the event by means of video and audio recordings
                            and the use of the recordings made for press and public relations purposes. There are no
                            plans to change these purposes. Additional information on the processing of data for the
                            specific event can be found on the Loop website: https://loop.ableton.com/privacy

                            <br>(ii) The processed data are: application and contact data (such as name, email),
                            voluntary extra data, communication data, usage data, and video and audio recordings.
                            Usually, you provide the data yourself when you apply for the Loop Event.

                            <br>(iii) The legal basis for the processing of personal data of prospective participants
                            and participants in Loop Events is Article 6 para. (1) (b) GDPR (contract for the
                            participation of the event) and Article 6 para. (1) (c) GDPR (statutory obligations, in
                            particular tax and commercial law provisions). The legal basis for the production of video
                            and audio recordings is Article 6 para. (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interest in the

                            Loop Event) is Article 6 (1) (a) in connection with Article 9 para. (2) (a) GDPR (consent).
                            We may also process your mostly aggregated data with our legitimate interest of aligning and

                            produced can also be transmitted abroad to journalists, media companies, press and photo
                            agencies as well as social media platforms and published by us in printed or digital form.
                            We use data processors like service providers to organize Loop Events and for the provision
                            of our services, in particular for the provision, maintenance and support of IT systems.

                            Some of our service providers offer the possibility to register directly to their end user
                            services. If you enter into such a direct contractual relationship with one of our service
                            providers the service provider is the independent controller for all data processing under
                            such contract.

                            We use the CRM (= customer relation management) service by salesforce.com GmbH as a
                            processor within the framework of a data processing agreement. We have concluded the EU
                            standard contractual clauses with salesforce.com and salesforce.com may only process your

                            being processed outside the EU) please refer to the Loop website
                            <a href="Ableton.html">https://loop.ableton.com/privacy</a> and privacy policies of the

                            payments. In individual cases, data may be transferred to debt collection service providers,
                            lawyers and courts.
